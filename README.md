# Spots

**Description**

This is an image sharing site showing different spots around the world. It is an interactive social media web application where users can add and remove photos and make a few minor adjustments to their proifles.

**Tech Stack**

- HTML

I used Semantic tags wishly to get a organize content logically and clearly, making it easier for both humans and machines to understand the struucture. This has got me to better under when to use div, h1, and p tags. Introducing more tags to include button, section, and the ul and il.

- CSS

Who does not like making things look good. Adding in margins and padding. Using BEM methodolgy to ensure a nice and smooth professinal webpage. Knowing how to use the hover effert has been fun. Here is where Flexbox and grid comes into perspective.

- Responsive Design

Putting @media to use for the first time was fun and challenging. Watching how @media can really change a look and style, really made a world of difference.
